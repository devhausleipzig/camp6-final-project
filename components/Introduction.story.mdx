# Welcome to Storybook for Camp 6 Final Project

We have an example component and story in the left sidebar for you to check out.

## Getting Started

Run the following comman to start storybook.

```
yarn storybook
```

## Creating Stories for Components

All components should have their own folder inside the components folder. The folder should contain the actual component plus the story file plus, eventually, a test file.

Once you have created a component folder and component file, create a story file and call it [componentName].story.tsx

Inside story file, copy from example or write

- **import** React ComponentStory, ComponentMeta

- **export default** that contains a title for the story and a component on which the story should be based (make sure to import the component or else it won't work)

- specify the **args** (based on component props)

- const **Template** containing all args

- **export const** for each test or variant case (e.g. primary, secondary or large button)

Full tutorial can be found [here](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/simple-component/).

## Organizing stories

On storybook, stories can be placed inside folders to better organize components.
To do that, simply change the title of the default export inside the story file.
